# DSA-Palmora-Group-Project
This project is focused on analysing the employee data of Plamoria Group in Nigeria, based on the accusations of gender inequality within the company by a media headline. 

### Project Aim:
The aim of this project is to analyse the Palmore group employee data, across all department and region and generate insights on the following:  
- The gender distribution in the organisation.
- Performance rating based on gender.
- Identify any pay dgap in the company salary structure, and in which department or region.
-  Reveal the pay distribution of employee by a band of $10,000 each and see if Palmora meets up with a recent regulation for manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000.

#### Data Source:
The data is a CSV file supplied by The Incubator Hub downloaded from my LMS into my local drive, it consist of 1465 rows and 16 columns.

#### Tools Used:
All the work was done using Power BI to perform the following:
- ETL, Extaction of the data from source, Transforming (data cleaning) before loading for proper analysis and visualisation.
- Joining the provided bonus rules table by unpivoting and merging columns.
- Creating calculated columns such as bonus amount, new salary, and salary range to achieve the project aim.
- Visualising the analysed table for proper insights and recommendations.

### Insights
- Overall, there is a resonable mixed representation of both gender in the organisation at the regional level, although with the male gender slightly hiher by ...%, but more attention should be paid to the Legal & support department.
- Most employee perfomance is on the average, with very few on the good and very good performance, which probably indicates a review on the perfomance criteria needed.
- Male employee earn slightly higher across all region, a closer review is recomended.
- The chart reveals that salaries should be reviewed for Palmora to meet up with the recent regulation for manufacturing companies.
